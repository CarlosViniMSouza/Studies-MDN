<h1>What is HTML?</h1>

<h4>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is not a programming language. It is a markup language that tells web browsers how to structure the web pages you visit. It can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer wants it to be. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of content to make it appear or act in a certain way. The enclosing tags can make content into a hyperlink to connect to another page, italicize words, and so on.  For example, consider the following line of text:</h4>

<p>My cat is very grumpy</p>


<h4> If we wanted the text to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in a paragraph (p) element:</h4>

<p>My cat is very grumpy</p>

<h1>Anatomy of an HTML element</h1>

<h4>Let's further explore our paragraph element from the previous section:</h4>

<h4>The anatomy of our element is:</h4>

<p><strong>° The opening tag:</strong>This consists of the name of the element (in this example, p for paragraph), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This opening tag marks where the element begins or starts to take effect. In this example, it precedes the start of the paragraph text.</p>

<p><strong>° The content:</strong>This is the content of the element. In this example, it is the paragraph text.</p>

<p><strong>° The closing tag:</strong>This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This marks where the element ends. Failing to include a closing tag is a common beginner error that can produce peculiar results.</p>

<h4>The element is the opening tag, followed by content, followed by the closing tag.</h4>
